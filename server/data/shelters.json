		"Description": "We are not at the Gravette location. That is our home. We strictly run Heavenly Paws via phone and text. We find fur babies needing homes and we hook them up with loving families. We go to potential new homes and do home inspections, deliver the fur baby for a “try” for a few days, and then if all goes well we come back and do the adoption. All of our babies are fully vetted including spay and neuter"
